/**
 * Authentication provider managing cross-platform authentication (CPA) with an authorization provider.
 *
 * For more information about CPA, please refer to the technical documentation: https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3366.pdf
 *
 * An authorization provider delivers tokens associating applications with an identity. Two modes are available:
 *   - client mode (unauthenticated association): An anonymous identity is created and the application is associated with it
 *   - user mode (authenticated associated): The application is linked with a user account, which requires the user to enter
 *     her credentials on some web page
 *
 * When an application has been successfully associated, a token is retrieved and stored in the keychain. This token can then
 * be retrieved to access other services on behalf of the identity. Note that a token might expire. If this is the case,
 * you can always retrieve a new one from the authorization provider.
 *
 * You can instantiate as many providers as required. In most cases a single provider should suffice, which you can 
 * instantiate and conveniently install as default provider by calling +setDefaultProvider:
 *
 * The authentication provider is intended to be used from the main application thread. Using it from any other thread
 * results in undefined behavior.
